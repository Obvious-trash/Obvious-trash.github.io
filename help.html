  <h1>We like trash, don't you.</h1>
	<b>  Why should we wast it?<b>
	The trash we wast is wasted trach.  We can make good use of it. <br>
	<p> If we recycle it then it can become new products.  But reusing it is even better.  We can reuse a class jar as a storage container.  
	That is <b>MUCH</b> better then just recycling it.</p>
