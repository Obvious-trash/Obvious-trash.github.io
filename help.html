  <h1>We like trash, don't you.</h1>
<b>  Why should we wast it?<b>
The trash we wast is wasted trach.  We can make good use of it.  If we recycle it then it can become new products.  But reusing it is even better.  We can reuse a class jar as a storage container.  That is <b>MUCH</b> better then just recycling it.
